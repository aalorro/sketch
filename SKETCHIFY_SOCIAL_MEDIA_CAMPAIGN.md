Here's what's new:

✨ MULTI-IMAGE BATCH PROCESSING  
Upload 20+ photos at once. Process all of them together. Download individually. Perfect for portfolios, family photos, or creative projects.

✨ 4K RESOLUTION SUPPORT
Generate sketches up to 4096x4096 pixels - true gallery-quality output that prints beautifully.

✨ SMOOTHING CONTROLS
Fine-tune the sketch texture with our new smoothing slider. Soft and delicate or sharp and defined - you decide.

```

##### 2. **Feature Spotlight Posts** (2x weekly)

**Format: One detailed feature per post**

Example - Pan & Zoom Feature:

```
🔍 FEATURE SPOTLIGHT: Pan & Zoom Controls 🔍

Here's something artists have been asking us for since day one:

"I want to control EXACTLY what gets sketched."

We listened.

With v1.2.0, you now have two powerful new abilities:

[IMAGE: Before/after or screenshot showing zoom]

ZOOM UP TO 300%
Hover in on every detail. Make sure those eyes are perfect. That smile is just right. That background asset is positioned exactly how you want it.

PAN & DRAG
Resize the image within the frame. Center it. Crop it. Reposition it. Complete composition control before you hit "Generate."

Why this matters:
You're not just generating random sketches anymore. You're creating INTENTIONAL artwork with precision control.

This is what separates casual doodling from serious creative work.

Try it free on your next photo project: [link]

Who else has been waiting for this level of control? Let us know in the comments! 👇

```

##### 3. **User Success Stories** (2x weekly)
- Share real transformations from users
- Get permission first
- Tell the story of HOW they used it
- Highlight emotional connection to result

Example:

```
💙 USER SPOTLIGHT: Sarah's Watercolor Dream 💙

Meet Sarah. She's an artist, but not the kind who draws. 

Sarah is a photographer. She'd always dreamed of having her photos turned into beautiful watercolor sketches - like the oil paintings hanging in galleries. But hiring an artist to paint each photo? Thousands of dollars per piece.

Last month, Sarah discovered Sketchify.

She uploaded her favorite sunset photo. Hit generate. And 30 seconds later, there it was: a STUNNING watercolor sketch, delivered instantly, completely free.

She's now in the process of creating a whole gallery collection.

"I never thought I'd be able to afford this kind of art," Sarah told us. "Sketchify changed that completely."

[BEFORE/AFTER IMAGE]

This is why we built Sketchify.

Because everyone should have access to powerful creative tools. Not just the wealthy. Not just the trained. Everyone.

What's YOUR dream project? Upload a photo and let's make it real: [link]

#SketchifyAI #ArtForEveryone #DigitalArt #CreativeTools
```

##### 4. **Educational/Tips Posts** (2x weekly)

```
💡 SKETCHIFY PRO TIP: Get the PERFECT Sketch 💡

Here's what separates "meh" sketches from STUNNING ones:

It's all about composition.

Step 1: Upload your image
Step 2: Use the ZOOM feature to identify what matters most
Step 3: Use the PAN feature to position that element perfectly in the frame
Step 4: Generate

The result? A sketch where the important details are in the perfect position.

Try this on a portrait: Zoom in on the eyes first. Pan until they're perfectly centered. Generate. Notice how much better the result looks?

Your turn - share a screenshot of a sketch you're proud of! Comment "DONE" below and tell us which tip helped you most! 👇

5. **Adapt Quickly**
   - What works in Week 1 might flop in Week 3
   - Look at analytics after each post
   - Double down on formats/topics that win
   - Be willing to pivot
